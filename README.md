# PlantaMuse
Being surrounded by plants is a very pleasant and gratifying experience that brings joy 
and satisfaction. It makes you feel close to nature and brings inner peace to oneâ€™s mind 
and soul. Most nature lovers grow different plants, shrubs, bushes, and flowers. As a 
result, a special bond is created between them and the plants. We often wonder if there 
was a way for these holy, divine, heavenly beings to communicate with us. Plants bring
happiness, joy, and bliss to our life but is there a way we could interact with them?
Planta-muse is a device that would function as a bridge between you and a plant. This 
device would help you to build a closer connection with your plant. This device would
create musical notes from the soul of plants. This is accomplished by making use of the 
electrical signals that are transmitted through them. It senses these signals and 
propagates them into a specific rhythm. Every plant would have a different rhythm. This
device is an attempt to give humans a feeling of communication between them and the 
plant.
This project is an attempt to expand our view of the world that we live in. It is an effort 
to serve as a reminder to us that we are not just existing on Earth; we are a part of a 
beautiful world that we might not even be aware of, and we must preserve it at all 
costs.
This project is divided into three parts: Python, Arduino and Application.
